# Basic information

I normally don't talk a lot.

## Anxiety

I have a bit of social anxiety. If see me avoiding eye contact or keeping distance in other ways, most likely it's anxiety kicking in, not you doing something wrong.

This is happening more often with people I'm not familiar with and gets less prominent over time.
